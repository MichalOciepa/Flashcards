## Project Overview 🎉
This is one of my javascript projects. The flashcard method is a proven and effective way to learn a foreign language. You can add new cards, but remember that in this version they will disappear after refreshing the page.

The project will be developed. In the future i want to add different categories and saving flashcards on the server.
